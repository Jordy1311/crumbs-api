# Crumbs API

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This is the backend API for a project currently under active development.

Don't get attached to the name, it's just a stand-in.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@whatever-from-mongodb
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `yarn` preferably (`npm i -g yarn` to install yarn - it's much faster than npm)
3. Set up your environment variables
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app into the `dist/` directory.

### `npm start`

Builds the app and starts the server.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode - runs un-compiled .ts files and watches for changes.
